       persona_scores = {}
       for persona in available_personas:
           score = calculate_expertise_match(persona, required_expertise)
           persona_scores[persona] = score

       # Consider workload and availability
       for persona, score in persona_scores.items():
           workload_factor = get_workload_factor(persona)
           adjusted_score = score * workload_factor
           persona_scores[persona] = adjusted_score

       # Select best match with availability
       best_persona = max(persona_scores, key=persona_scores.get)
       return best_persona

3. Load Balancing Rules
