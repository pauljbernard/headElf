# How to Create Executive Strategic Requirements

Your **strategic requirements** define the business objectives, constraints, and success metrics that guide all executive decisions. This structured business meta-code enables HeadElf to optimize recommendations for your specific strategic context and measurable outcomes.

## What are Executive Strategic Requirements?

Strategic requirements are executable business logic that defines:
- **Strategic objectives** with measurable outcomes
- **Operational constraints** that limit decision options
- **Resource parameters** that guide investment decisions
- **Timeline requirements** that affect implementation planning
- **Success metrics** that determine decision effectiveness
- **Compliance obligations** that constrain operational choices

## Step-by-Step Requirements Development

### Step 1: Strategic Objectives Definition

Define specific, measurable business objectives that guide executive decision-making:

```markdown
# Strategic Requirements 2024-2026
