**Context-driven executive intelligence platform that transforms business decision-making through "business as meta-code" - where your organizational DNA becomes executable intelligence.**

## 🚀 Dual-Lifecycle Architecture

HeadElf operates on a dual-lifecycle model where business leaders create **business meta-code** that transforms generic C-suite capabilities into specialized Cxx intelligence:

### 🛠️ Lifecycle 1: Framework Enhancement
**For developers enhancing HeadElf's context utilization intelligence:**
- Improve how HeadElf consumes and processes executive context artifacts
- Enhance organizational pattern recognition and decision quality algorithms
- Develop industry vertical and enterprise context extensions

### 👔 Lifecycle 2: Executive Intelligence Deployment
**For executives building personalized intelligence through business meta-code:**
- **Create business constitution**: Your organization's fundamental operating principles
- **Define strategic requirements**: Business objectives, constraints, and success metrics
- **Build context artifacts**: Organizational culture, stakeholder dynamics, proven patterns
- **Deploy executive repository**: Git-based intelligence that evolves with every decision

## Business as Meta-Code: The Core Concept

**Traditional Business Tools**: Generic recommendations based on broad best practices
**HeadElf Context Intelligence**: Personalized recommendations based on YOUR organization's proven patterns

### **Your Business Constitution as Operating System**
```markdown
# Organizational Decision Framework
## Core Values
- Data-driven decisions with cultural sensitivity
- Stakeholder alignment before major changes
- Risk-managed innovation over pure speed

## Decision Authority Matrix
- Board approval required: >$10M, strategic pivots
- Executive autonomy: operational decisions
- Team consensus needed: cultural changes

## Risk Tolerance Profile
- Financial: Conservative with operations, aggressive with growth
- Technology: Early adopter for competitive advantage
- Market: Opportunistic expansion, defensive in core
```

### **Context Artifacts Transform Decision Quality**

**Example: M&A Decision Without Context Artifacts**
```
Generic M&A Framework:
✓ Financial due diligence
✓ Market analysis
✓ Integration planning
```

**Example: M&A Decision With Rich Context Artifacts**
```
Your Organization's M&A Intelligence:
✓ Financial due diligence (using YOUR CFO's proven frameworks)
✓ Market analysis (incorporating YOUR competitive intelligence)
✓ Cultural fit assessment (based on YOUR organizational patterns)
✓ Stakeholder communication (customized to YOUR board's style)
✓ Integration approach (aligned with YOUR change capabilities)
✓ Risk assessment (calibrated to YOUR risk tolerance)
```

**Result**: Decisions that aren't just technically sound, but optimized for success in YOUR specific organizational context.

## Executive Repository: Your Business Intelligence DNA

**The Core Innovation**: Executives create repositories containing their **business meta-code** - structured organizational intelligence that HeadElf processes to deliver specialized Cxx decisions.

### **Executive Repository Structure**
```
your-executive-intelligence/
├── business-constitution.md          # Organizational operating principles
├── strategic-requirements.md         # Business objectives and constraints
