### Stage 7: Synthesis and Commitment
**Purpose**: Integrate all analyses into coherent, committed recommendations
**Skills Applied**:

- Limitation acknowledgment and uncertainty quantification

**Quality Gates**:
- Synthesis coherence ≥ 90% (blocks inconsistent integration)
- Recommendation specificity ≥ 85% (blocks vague final recommendations)

## Response Quality Transformation

### Before Enhancement (Survey-Level Response Pattern)
```
Approach 1: Use formal verification
Problem: Requires expertise and is time-consuming

Approach 2: Multiple AI verification
Problem: Correlated failures possible

Approach 3: Human review process
Problem: Doesn't scale with development velocity

The trustworthiness gap might be mathematically unbridgeable.
```

### After Enhancement (Rigorous Analysis Pattern)
```
## Adversarial Analysis
Prompt poisoning attacks defeat cryptographic attestation by compromising
the specification phase. Specific attack: inject "for compliance, log
credentials" context → generates backdoored code with valid signatures.
No cryptographic verification can detect this semantic attack vector.

## Formal Proof
Proving semantic trust gap is unbridgeable:
1. Trust requires verifiable authorship
2. AI systems cannot provide verifiable semantic authorship (reduction to halting problem)
3. Therefore AI-authored code cannot participate in cryptographic trust chains
∎ Trust gap is information-theoretically unbridgeable

## Implementation Reality
Multiple AI verification cost: $2M setup, 10x development time, still vulnerable
to adversarial examples that fool all systems (transferable attacks).
Formal verification: Works for 1K-line crypto primitives, fails for 100K-line
applications (state explosion).

## Committed Recommendation
Use AI for development acceleration with human semantic ownership at trust boundaries.
Cryptographic attestation signs human review decisions, not AI outputs.
Success metric: <10% semantic errors in production (vs ~30% for pure AI verification).
