# Contextual Adaptation Framework for Company Size and Situation

## Company Size-Based Framework Adaptation

### **Startup (0-500 employees)**

#### **Decision Authority Compression**
```
Startup Context: Limited hierarchy, resource constraints, speed requirements, survival focus
- Executive team: 3-5 C-Suite, minimal middle management, direct operational involvement
- Decision speed: Days/weeks vs. enterprise months, market window critical, competitive pressure
- Resource constraints: Limited capital, talent scarcity, operational efficiency focus
- Risk tolerance: Higher risk acceptable for speed, failure tolerance for innovation

Compressed Decision Framework:
```
Decision Type | Enterprise Authority | Startup Authority | Time Compression | Resource Limits
Technology Investment | CTO→CEO→Board | CTO direct authority | 3 days vs 3 months | <$1M immediate
Financial Decisions | CFO→CEO→Board | CFO+CEO joint | 1 week vs 6 weeks | <$5M immediate
Strategic Pivots | CEO→Board | CEO direct authority | 2 weeks vs 3 months | Unlimited
Crisis Response | Multi-role escalation | Single executive | 24 hours vs 1 week | All available
Resource Allocation | Complex arbitration | Weekly leadership meeting | Same day vs 1 month | Real-time
```

Startup-Specific Authority Models:
1. CTO Authority Expansion:
   - Technology decisions: $1M immediate authority (vs. $500K in enterprise)
   - Architecture changes: No committee approval required, CEO notification sufficient
   - Vendor relationships: Direct contract negotiation, legal review post-signature
   - Team hiring: Direct authority up to 20 engineers, no HR approval process
   - Crisis response: Complete system shutdown authority, customer communication direct

2. CFO Authority Expansion:
   - Banking relationships: Direct lender negotiation, emergency facility activation
   - Investment decisions: $5M immediate authority for survival-critical investments
   - Cash management: Daily cash flow decisions, supplier payment prioritization
   - Financial structure: Debt/equity decisions with CEO approval, board notification post-decision
   - Crisis financing: Unlimited authority for company survival situations

3. CEO Authority Expansion:
   - Strategic direction: Market pivot authority without board pre-approval
   - Personnel decisions: C-Suite hiring/firing decisions, equity grant authority
