   ```
   Project | Investment | 3-Yr NPV | IRR | Payback | Strategic Score | Risk Level | Total Score
   CRM Upgrade | $8M | $15M | 28% | 2.1yr | 7/10 (efficiency) | Low | 8.2
   AI Platform | $20M | $25M | 18% | 3.8yr | 9/10 (competitive) | High | 7.1
   Manufacturing | $15M | $22M | 22% | 2.9yr | 6/10 (cost reduction) | Medium | 7.8
   International | $25M | $18M | 12% | 4.5yr | 8/10 (growth) | High | 6.8
   Security Upgrade | $7M | $5M | 8% | 6.2yr | 8/10 (compliance) | Low | 6.4
   R&D Lab | $10M | $8M | 15% | 4.1yr | 9/10 (innovation) | High | 6.9
   ```

2. Arbitration Decision Process:
   Stage 1: Financial Threshold Analysis (CFO Authority)
   - Minimum IRR requirement: 15% for discretionary investments
   - Maximum payback period: 4 years for non-strategic investments
   - Risk-adjusted NPV weighting: Multiply NPV by (1 - risk probability)
   - Result: CRM Upgrade and Manufacturing meet financial thresholds

   Stage 2: Strategic Value Assessment (Business Unit Input)
   - Competitive necessity: Market requirement vs. nice-to-have enhancement
   - Revenue protection: Existing revenue at risk vs. growth opportunity
   - Timeline criticality: Competitive window vs. flexible implementation
   - Customer impact: Direct customer benefit vs. internal efficiency
   - Result: AI Platform and Security Upgrade classified as strategic necessities

   Stage 3: Portfolio Optimization (Joint Decision)
   - Resource constraints: Available capital, implementation capacity, risk tolerance
   - Synergy identification: Projects with shared benefits, combined implementation
   - Phasing opportunities: Multi-year investment plans, milestone-based funding
   - Compromise solutions: Reduced scope, phased rollouts, partnership models
