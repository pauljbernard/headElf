### **Multi-Variable Crisis Scenario Generator**

#### **Crisis Parameter Matrix**
```
Crisis Generation Algorithm: Parameter Selection → Scenario Construction → Decision Tree Creation

Crisis Dimensions:

   - Operational (Supply chain, manufacturing, quality)
   - Market (Competition, regulation, customer loss)
   - Human (Key personnel, workplace crisis, talent exodus)

├─ Crisis Magnitude:
   - Local: Single department, <$1M impact, <100 people affected
   - Regional: Multiple departments, $1-10M impact, 100-1K people
   - Enterprise: Company-wide, $10-100M impact, 1K-10K people
   - Industry: Multi-company, >$100M impact, >10K people affected

├─ Crisis Timeline:
   - Acute: Resolution required in hours/days, immediate authority needed
   - Chronic: Resolution over weeks/months, strategic planning required
   - Cyclical: Recurring pattern, process improvement opportunity
   - Progressive: Escalating severity, early intervention critical

├─ Stakeholder Complexity:
   - Internal: Employees, management, board
   - Customer: Revenue impact, reputation risk, service disruption
